LOGISTICS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

Objective: Investigate root causes of delivery delays and provide data-driven insights and recommendations for operational improvement.

Analysis Overview

As part of a proactive diagnostic initiative, a logistics dataset was provided to assess patterns of delay and identify actionable opportunities. The process followed three key stages:

Data Cleaning: Performed in Excel to ensure consistency and remove noise.
Data Analysis: Structured within Microsoft SQL Server for deeper querying.
Data Visualization: Connected to Power BI for interactive insights and pattern detection.


Key Insights

1. High Operational Volume, Strained Responsiveness

$299K+ in Transactions and 1,000+ Trips indicate strong operational throughput.
However, an average waiting time of 35 units and 566 total waiting instances flag bottlenecks.

Implication: Throughput is high, but system responsiveness is lagging; this poses a customer satisfaction and efficiency challenge.


2. Delay Disproportionately Impacts High-Value Customers

A scatter plot analysis shows that customers with higher transaction values experience longer delays

Risk: Potential damage to brand perception among top-tier clients.
Possible Cau: Overloaded premium lanes, unrealistic SLAs, or prioritization misalignment.

3. Delivery Segmentation Reveals SLA Misfit

Cluster patterns reveal that late deliveries are more concentrated among premium spenders.

Insight: Service tier expectations may not be aligned with operational capacity.

4. Customer Type Analysis: Risk & Opportunity

Premium customers receive relatively more reliable service.
One-time buyers, however, face greater friction, possibly reducing retention.

Opportunity: Improve experience for one-time customers to increase lifetime value.


 âœ… Recommendations

1. Optimize Fleet & Routing Efficiency

Reassess current routing logic and increase fleet capacity or routing algorithm efficiency to minimize wait times.

2. Realign SLAs With Capacity

Set realistic expectations for delivery times based on operational limits, especially for premium tiers.

3. Enhance Delay Attribution Accuracy

Improve data tagging and delay categorization to identify true systemic causes (e.g., mechanical, traffic, scheduling).

4. Balance Service Equity Across Customer Segments

Ensure mechanical reliability and resource allocation isn't skewed toward only premium customers.

5. Strengthen Customer Retention Strategy

Convert one-time buyers by offering targeted promotions, tiered guarantees, and priority services during high-demand periods.

6. Prepare for Demand Spikes

Leverage predictive analytics to staff and allocate resources ahead of surge events.



ðŸ’¡ Strategic Opportunity

Revenue Efficiency Play: By improving service for one-time buyers and converting them to regular/premium customers, revenue can grow without a proportional increase in logistics cost.
This shift can be scalable and margin-friendly, if supported by data-driven operational planning.
